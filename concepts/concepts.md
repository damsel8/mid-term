## NOTE: there is no READme or javascript file for this prompt. Just answer each question below in your own words and be as thorough as possible.

1. When would you use a for loop and when would you use a for-in loop?
use a for loop to iterate thru an array,
 use a for-in looop to iterate thru an object's elements;

2. What is an anonymous function? Why would we want to use one?  
a function that only displays or gets used once, it is not assigned to a variable.  It is the inner workings and the function that is called back in higher order functions.

3. What is an IIFE, and how is it written?

Immediately Invoked Function Expression, is a common JavaScript design pattern used by most popular libraries  to place all library code inside of a local scope

4. Why do we write tests for our code?

in order to understand if our code works, to de-bug it before we know if it works.  It is composed of 'describing the code (what it's name is), it (defining what it does) and expecting (listing what we expect the outcome to be given certain inputs).

5. What does it mean to clone a repo?

to capture it on the terminal, to copy it and give it a remote location on the terminal... so it can then be downloaded into our local folder(s)

6. What is a higher order function? What is a callback?

a higher order function is a function that calls upon another function (an anonymous function) and it allows us to write "less repetitive code (DRY)" by being able to use "loop" that is called upon with parameters of a collection, and a function (anonymous).
